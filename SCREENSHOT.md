# Screenshot Placeholder

A proper screenshot.png file (1200x900) should be created showing:
- The theme's homepage layout
- A sample blog post with code highlighting
- Minimal design aesthetic
- Readable typography

For now, this is a placeholder. The actual screenshot should be created by:
1. Installing the theme in a WordPress instance
2. Adding sample content (blog posts with code snippets)
3. Taking a screenshot at 1200x900 resolution
4. Saving as screenshot.png in the theme root

The screenshot is required for theme submission to WordPress.org theme directory.
