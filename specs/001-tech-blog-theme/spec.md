# Feature Specification: Modern Tech Blog WordPress Theme

**Feature Branch**: `001-tech-blog-theme`  
**Created**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "modem wordpress theme for tech blog forcus readable, minimal, seo performance and code-friendly."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Content Reading Experience (Priority: P1)

A tech blog reader visits the site to read articles about programming, technology, and development topics. The theme provides a distraction-free, highly readable experience that makes consuming technical content effortless.

**Why this priority**: The primary purpose of a blog is content consumption. If readers struggle to read articles, the blog fails its core mission regardless of other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by publishing sample articles with various content types (code snippets, images, headings) and measuring readability scores, reading time, and user feedback on content clarity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader visits an article page, **When** they scroll through the content, **Then** the text is presented with optimal line length (50-75 characters), comfortable line height (1.6-1.8), and sufficient contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1)
2. **Given** an article contains code snippets, **When** the reader views them, **Then** code blocks are syntax-highlighted, easily distinguishable from regular text, and horizontally scrollable on small screens without breaking layout
3. **Given** a reader is on a mobile device, **When** they view any article, **Then** all text remains readable without zooming, images scale appropriately, and interactive elements are easily tappable (minimum 44x44px)
4. **Given** an article contains multiple headings and sections, **When** the reader scans the content, **Then** the visual hierarchy makes it easy to distinguish between heading levels and navigate the document structure

### User Story 2 - SEO Performance & Discoverability (Priority: P1)

Search engines and social media platforms need to efficiently crawl, index, and display the blog content to maximize organic traffic and social sharing.

**Why this priority**: Without good SEO performance, the blog won't reach its audience. This is critical for blog success and must be built into the foundation, not added later.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running Google Lighthouse audits, checking structured data validation, measuring page load times, and verifying social media preview cards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a search engine crawler visits any page, **When** it analyzes the HTML, **Then** all pages include proper semantic HTML5 markup, meta descriptions, Open Graph tags, and structured data (Article schema)
2. **Given** a page is loaded, **When** performance is measured, **Then** the page achieves a Lighthouse performance score of 90+ with First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds and Largest Contentful Paint under 2.5 seconds
3. **Given** a user shares an article on social media, **When** the link is posted, **Then** a rich preview card appears with the correct title, description, featured image, and author information
4. **Given** images are loaded on any page, **When** network conditions vary, **Then** images use modern formats (WebP with fallbacks), include proper alt text, and implement lazy loading for below-the-fold content

---

### User Story 3 - Developer-Friendly Code Display (Priority: P2)

Developers reading technical articles need to easily copy, understand, and interact with code examples presented in blog posts.

**Why this priority**: Tech blog readers frequently need to reference and copy code snippets. Poor code presentation frustrates the target audience and reduces content value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by publishing articles with various programming languages, measuring code copying success rates, and gathering developer feedback on code readability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an article contains code snippets, **When** a reader views them, **Then** each code block displays with syntax highlighting appropriate to the language, line numbers (optional), and a one-click copy button
2. **Given** a code block contains long lines, **When** viewed on any screen size, **Then** the code is horizontally scrollable without breaking the page layout or making the entire page scroll horizontally
3. **Given** multiple code languages are used in an article, **When** a reader views them, **Then** each code block clearly indicates its programming language and uses appropriate syntax highlighting
4. **Given** a developer wants to reference inline code, **When** they see `code snippets` within paragraphs, **Then** inline code is visually distinct from regular text using a different font, background color, or styling

---

### User Story 4 - Minimal & Focused Design (Priority: P2)

Blog visitors want to focus on content without distractions from excessive UI elements, animations, or visual clutter.

**Why this priority**: Minimal design directly supports readability and performance goals. However, it's secondary to the actual reading experience and SEO fundamentals.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by conducting user focus groups, measuring time-on-page metrics, and analyzing bounce rates compared to industry standards.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader visits any page, **When** they view the layout, **Then** the design uses ample white space, limited color palette (2-3 primary colors), and clear visual hierarchy with no more than one optional sidebar
2. **Given** a user navigates the site, **When** they interact with any element, **Then** animations and transitions are subtle (under 200ms), serve a functional purpose, and can be disabled via user preference
3. **Given** content is displayed, **When** a reader scans the page, **Then** the focus remains on the article text with navigation, sidebar widgets, and footer elements using muted colors and smaller typography
4. **Given** an article page loads, **When** the reader views it, **Then** there are no pop-ups, slide-ins, or auto-playing media that interrupt the reading experience within the first 30 seconds

---

### User Story 5 - Navigation & Content Discovery (Priority: P3)

Readers want to easily find related content, navigate between articles, and discover older posts relevant to their interests.

**Why this priority**: While important for engagement and reducing bounce rates, navigation can be added incrementally and doesn't block the core reading and SEO functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring pages-per-session, time-on-site, and conducting A/B tests on different navigation patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader finishes an article, **When** they reach the end, **Then** they see 3-5 related articles based on categories, tags, or content similarity
2. **Given** a reader wants to explore topics, **When** they use the main navigation, **Then** they can access articles by category, tag, or chronological archive
3. **Given** a reader is browsing, **When** they view any page, **Then** a search function is available that indexes all published content and returns relevant results within 1 second
4. **Given** a user wants quick access to recent content, **When** they view the homepage or any page, **Then** the latest 5-10 articles are clearly presented with titles, excerpts, and publication dates

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an article contains extremely long code blocks (500+ lines)? System should provide collapsible sections or a "view full code" option to prevent excessive scrolling.
- How does the theme handle non-English characters or right-to-left languages? System should support UTF-8 encoding and maintain readability with international character sets.
- What happens when images fail to load or are missing? System should display graceful fallbacks with alt text and placeholder styling.
- How does the theme perform on extremely slow connections (2G/3G)? System should implement progressive enhancement, loading critical content first with optional enhancements.
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? Core reading functionality and navigation must remain accessible without JavaScript.
- How does the theme handle very long article titles (100+ characters)? System should truncate or wrap titles gracefully without breaking layout.
- What happens when code blocks contain special characters or HTML entities? System should properly escape content to prevent rendering issues or security vulnerabilities.
