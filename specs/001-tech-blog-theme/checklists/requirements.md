- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓

All requirements focus on what the theme should accomplish (readability, performance, SEO) rather than how to implement it. No specific frameworks, libraries, or technical implementations are mentioned. The spec is written in business/user-focused language that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓

- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete and actionable with reasonable industry-standard defaults applied
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001 specifies measurable line width, FR-015 specifies Lighthouse score)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include specific metrics (percentages, time limits, scores)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without implementation details
- **Complete scenarios**: Each user story includes multiple acceptance scenarios covering the main flow
- **Edge cases covered**: 7 distinct edge cases identified covering error conditions, performance constraints, and accessibility
- **Clear scope**: Feature is bounded to WordPress theme functionality for tech blogs with specific focus areas

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓

- **40 functional requirements** organized by category (Content Display, Code Display, SEO, Design, Navigation, Mobile, Content Management)
- **5 prioritized user stories** with independent test descriptions
- **23 measurable success criteria** covering performance, readability, accessibility, and engagement
- **6 key entities** defined with clear attributes and relationships
- **No implementation leakage**: Spec maintains focus on requirements without prescribing solutions

## Notes

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for the next phase**

The specification successfully captures all essential aspects of a modern tech blog WordPress theme:

1. **Strong focus on core requirements**: Readability (P1), SEO (P1), and code-friendly features (P2) align with user input
2. **Measurable outcomes**: All success criteria include specific metrics for validation
3. **User-centric approach**: 5 user stories prioritized by business value with independent testing capability
4. **Comprehensive coverage**: 40 functional requirements covering all major aspects without prescribing implementation
5. **No clarifications needed**: Used industry-standard defaults for all aspects (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA for accessibility, Lighthouse 90+ for performance, standard responsive breakpoints)

**Ready to proceed with**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
